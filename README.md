# Project: Investment Portfolio Performance


## Objective:
Develop a dashboard that visualizes the performance of investment portfolios based on user transactions and market data.

## Key Features:

* Portfolio Overview: Display a summary of each user's investment portfolio, including total value, asset allocation, and performance metrics.
* Transaction Analysis: Visualize transaction history, including buy/sell transactions, transaction volume, and transaction types.
* Market Trends: Incorporate market data to track price trends for individual investments and sectors.
* Performance Metrics: Calculate and display key performance indicators (KPIs) such as return on investment (ROI), volatility, and Sharpe ratio.
* Interactive Filters: Allow users to filter and drill down into specific portfolios, time periods, and investment categories.

## Technologies:

* BigQuery: Store and query the investment data.
* Tableau: Create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
* SQL: Write queries to extract and transform the data from BigQuery.
